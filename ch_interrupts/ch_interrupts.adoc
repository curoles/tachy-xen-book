== Interrupts

http://www-archive.xenproject.org/files/xen_interface.pdf says:
A virtual IDT is provided - a domain can submit a table of
trap handlers to Xen via the `set_trap_table()` hypercall.

=== PV Interrupts and events

The hypervisor handles the interrupts, turns them into _events_ that
get delivered asynchronously to the target domain using a callback
supplied via the `set_callbacks()` hypercall.
A guest OS can map these events onto its standard interrupt dispatch mechanisms.
